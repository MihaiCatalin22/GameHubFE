I am Cătălin Mihai Popoiu, a student in class CB-04 of Semester 3 at Fontys ICT.

This is the GIT repository of my individual project, a project for gamers, made by a gamer.

My project is envisioned as a social networking platform dedicated to gamers, offering a space to connect, share, discuss and discover new games. You can track your favourite games, you can engage with the community and you can organize events, all of these features being aimed to enhance the user's gaming experience across different platforms.

Why This Project?

Community Focus:
Fills a niche for a gamer-centric social network, fostering a strong sense of community and belonging.

Technical Breadth:
Offers a challenge across full-stack development, real-time communication, and data analytics.

Market Potential:
Gaming continues to grow as an industry and culture. This platform addresses the need for a unified space for discussion, discovery, and sharing.

Expandability:
The platform can evolve to include more features like live streaming integrations, marketplace for in-game items, or a mobile app for on-the-go access.
